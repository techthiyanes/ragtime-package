The *Ragtime* project is intended to help every LLM user to strengthen its project and development. It is a LLM Ops project.

Contributors can help in 2 ways:
1. Develop a use case based on *Ragtime*
2. Add features to the *Ragtime* package

In the first case, the use case can be added in the `ragtime_projects` GitHub.
